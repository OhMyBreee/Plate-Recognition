# Define the path to the dataset root folder
# This path is relative to the location of the data.yaml file itself.
# path: ./Indonesian License Plate Dataset 

# Define the relative paths from the 'path' root to the image folders
# YOLOv8 expects images to be split into train/val/test
# Assuming all your data is together, you should split it first.
# For simplicity, we'll assume a single folder for now:

train: ../data/processed/images/train
val: ../data/processed/images/val
test: ../data/processed/images/test

# Number of classes
nc: 1

# Class names in order (replace 'plate' if you have specific classes)
names: ['license_plate']
